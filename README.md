# Smoke-A-Matic
The Arduino based smoker damper controller originally developed by Archy Wigglestyn.
This controller uses an Arduino uno to control the temperature of a grill or smoker by measuring the temp through a thermistor 
Running the numbers through a PID library then outputing to a hobby servo, fan, or electric element.
a 16x4 screen, 3 buttons and 1 switch are used to interface.

Smoke-A-Matic 3.0 is out!!!
This new update uses thermistors instead of a thermocouple. the old version worked, but was buggy.
Now you can use 3 meat probes with an alarm pin that blinks when they have reach a desired temp.
This controller uses replacment thermistors for a Maverick ET732/ET733 grilling thermometer, but you can still use 
your own if you want!
Read the sketch for details on setting it up.
