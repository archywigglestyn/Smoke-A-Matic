# Smoke-A-Matic
The Arduino based smoker damper controller thingy originally developed by Archy Wigglestyn.
This controller uses an Arduino uno to control the temperature of a grill or smoker by measuring the temp through a thermocouple. 
Running the numbers through the PID library then outputing to a hobby servo.
a 16x4 screen, 3 buttons and 1 switch are used to interface.

Update, A second version using pwm/pulsing as an output has been released.

6/11/17 a third version is now available for use with electric heating elements!
